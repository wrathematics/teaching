##
### Homework 2
* Live on BlackBoard now
* Due Friday before midnight.
* USE THE NOTES
* Questions?


##
### Today's Learning Objectives
* Learn about the how's and why's of version control.
* Learn some basic `git` workflows.
* Understand the difference between git and GitHub.




# Background

##
### Data Management
* "They're going to have to know it when they get to work, so sure.  Good idea."
* CODE ***IS*** DATA
* For many, code *most important* data they have!
* Learning to manage code well a *critical skill*.


##
### File Management Without Version Control
* file.txt
* file1.txt
* file2.txt
* file2a.txt
* file2a1.txt
* file2a1_final.txt
* file2a1_final1.txt
* ...


##
### Story Time!
Names have been changed to protect the innocent.


##
### Question
* Would you...
    * Use Word without "track changes"?
    * 
* SO DON'T WRITE CODE WITHOUT GIT!





# Version Control

# git vs GitHub
* git: Version control system
* GitHub: Web interface for git + cloud backup


##
### File Management With Version Control
* Make your edits.
* Commit them.
* Search history whenever you want.


##
### Philosophy
* How often to commit?
* How "big" should each commit be?
* Kind of irrelevant; just do what works for you/your team.


##
### Terminology
* repository (repo): 
* remote: a repository stored somewhere else (like a cloud backup)
* fork: 
* diff: 





# git

##
### 99% of Commands You Need
* `git init`: create new git repo
* `git status`: see what files have changed
* `git add`: "stage" files
* `git commit`: commit changes to repo
* `git log`: show commit log
* `git diff`: show what has changed
* `git show`: look at old diffs
* `git push`: send changes to remote
* `git pull`: grab changes from remote


##
### .gitignore
* Some files (often binary) you *never* want to track:
    * .pdf
    * .exe
    * .o
    * knitr cache files
    * etc.
* Avoid them showing up in your search path with `.gitignore`.


##
### Example .gitignore File
```
*~
*.pdf
*.html
*.swp

src/*.o
src/*.so
```






# Live Demo

## 
### Setting up
* Install git...
* You can work from a Linux VM, Newton, or your laptop:
    * **Windows**: Open "git shell".
    * **Mac**: Open Terminal.App.
    * **Linux**: Open a terminal.

### Do Me a Favor?
* Everyone go star this repo: https://github.com/heckendorfc/harp
* Trust me, it'll be hilarious








# Wrapup

##
### Advanced Topics
* Branching
* Stashing
* Rewriting history
* Fixing broken things (bad merges, ...)
* Some useful links:
    * Advanced git: https://help.github.com/categories/advanced-git/
    * git Flight Rules: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules


##
### Really Learning git
* Just use it.
* Make mistakes and break stuff.
* Keep at it.


##
### Wrapup
* It's been fun!
* git homework coming soon.
* Don't forget about HW2.
* Thanks!
