## Today's Learning Objectives
* 





# Regular Expressions

## sed and grep
* `grep`: Global Regular Expression Printer
* `sed`: Stream EDitor
* Also `awk`; beyond scope of this course.

## Regular Expressions

# Scripting

## Shell Facts
* Programming language
* Only one data type (character!)
* **Many** implementations.
* Lumped in with userland stuff like `[`


## Scripting Basics
* Sometimes given file extension `.sh` (many don't bother)
* Should have executable permissions --- `chmod +x file`
* Execute with `./` --- `./file`


## Example: Hello World
```bash
echo "echo hello world" > hw.sh
chmod +x hw.sh
./hw.sh
```

## 
* First line usually a "shebang"
    * `#!/bin/sh`
    * `#!/bin/bash`


##
* Interactive $\iff$ script
* 


## Exit status
* `exit 0`: good
* Any other number: bad...
* Check exit status: `echo $?`



# Variables and Loops

## Variables
* Character only!
* Arithmetic is possible, but fiddly
* Canonical use: storing paths
* Undefined variables are "blanks"


## Variable Syntax
* Set value of `x` to string `foo` --- `x=foo`
* Set value of `x` to result of command `bar` --- ``x=`bar` ``
* Access value of `x` --- `$x`
* Encase in brackets for safety: `${x}`


## Example
```bash
x=pwd
echo $x

x=`pwd`
echo $x

echo x
```


## Loop Syntax
```bash
for var in $VAR; do
		...
done
```

## Inlining a Command
```bash
for var in `command`; do
		...
done
```


## Example
```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do
		echo $i
done
```


## Example
```bash
numbers="1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
for i in $numbers; do
    echo $i
done
```


## Example
```bash
for i in `seq 1 10`; do
    echo $i
done
```


## Loops Wrapup
* `while` also possible, but less useful
* BASH has other `for` loop forms (e.g., `for ((i=1;i<=10;i++))`)
* Don't forget!
    * No `$` on name declaration.
    * Need `$` inside loop body!





# Logic

## If Syntax
```bash
if [ EXPRESSION ]; then
    ...
elif [ EXPRESSION ]
    ...
else
    ...
fi
```



## Operators
* Negation: `!`
* And: `EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2`
* Or: `EXPRESSION1 -o EXPRESSION2`

## Strings
* String has non-zero length: `-n STRING`
    * `-n s` is `true`
    * `-n ""` is `false`
* Equality: `STRING1 = STRING2`
    * `a = a` is `true`
    * `a = b` is `false`
* Inequality: `STRING1 != STRING2`


## PAY ATTENTION RIGHT THIS SECOND
![](../pics/nuclear_meltdown.jpg)


## The Worst Bug in the World
* `=` breaks if one string has zero length
* This happens literally all the time
* It is very difficult to debug
* I'M WARNING YOU NOW


## Example: WATCH OUT
```bash
[ $this_doesnt_exist = foo ]
echo $?
## 1

if [ $this_doesnt_exist = foo ];then
		echo "hi"
fi
## bash: [: =: unary operator expected
```


## Solutions
* Always test if a variable is length 0 (`-n`).
* Modify your test:
    ```bash
    if [ X$this_doesnt_exist = Xfoo ];then
    ```


## Example
```bash
if [ ! -e foo ]; then
    touch foo
else
    rm foo
fi
```
