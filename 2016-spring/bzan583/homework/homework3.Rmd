*Due*: Monday, Feb 8, 2016 by 11:59pm.

Questions about syntax assume you are using the non-gui form for git that we saw in class.  So on Windows, you would use `git shell`, and on Mac/Linux you would use the terminal.


1. (10 pts) Give valid syntax to create a new git repository.


2. (10 pts) Suppose in our git repo, we have created a new, non-empty file `myscript.r`.  Give valid syntax to stage the file (and only this file) to be committed (but don't commit it).


3. (10 pts) Give valid syntax to commit the file you staged in problem 2 above, with the commit message done "in line" (as in class), with the message "adding myscript.r".


4. (10 pts) If we had a remote named `origin` (say on GitHub), what command would send our local changes to the remote for the `master` branch?  (Hint: not `pull` but...)


5. (10 pts) Briefly explain the difference between git and GitHub.
