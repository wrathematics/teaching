# Learning Objectives

## The Next 3 Classes
1. Shell basics (today)
2. Shell scripting
3. wrapup + git


## Today's Learning Objectives
* Gain some historical perspective.
* Understand why we need this stuff.
* Become acquainted with basic interactions with the shell.
* Learn about basic system monitoring.
* Discuss file manipulation.





# Background

## Some Dates
* UNIX: Bell labs, 1970
* GNU: MIT, 1983
* Linux: University of Helsinki, 1991


## The GNU Perspective...

\textit{I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/LInux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.}



## The Confusion
* "Linux"
* Mac OS X
* FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, ... ("the BSD's")
* Solaris


## It's So Old! Why Now?
* Free (beer/speech)
* Powerful
* Multi-user by design.
* Great for servers and batch computing.
* Guess what big data needs...


## Example Use Cases
* Servers --- persistence (data consumption)
    * Grab data from a service periodically (e.g., scraping twitter)
    * Running a database
* Batch Computing --- long running jobs (data analysis)
    * data mining
    * statistical modeling




# Basics

## Some Basics
* No drive letters (yay!)
* No registry (YAY!)
* \emph{Everything} is a file.
* Multi-user design.


## Getting Help --- `man`
* Manual --- built in help
* Useful for identifying flags
* Often not well-written...
```bash
man ls
```

## Getting Help --- The Internet
* google/duckduckgo/...
* stackoverflow
* Phrases: 
    * shell
    * scripting
    * bash
    * linux


## Searching
* Many programs (`man`, `less`, `vim`, ...) use `/` to search.
* Example: start `man ls` and enter: `/disable`
* Find next match: `n`
* Find previous match: `N`


## Permissions
* root --- has access to everything
* regular user does not:
```bash
mkdir /bin/nope
## mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/bin/nope’: Permission denied
```
* Also group permissions (beyond scope)



## Directories

* Separated by a `/`
* Relative: `dir1/dir2`
* Absolute: `/home/user/dir1/dir2`
* `pwd`
* `~` (`/home/your_user_name`)


# Dir Dots
* `.` --- current working directory
* `..` --- parent working directory
* `...` --- not valid; means nothing
* `../..` --- parent of parent directory
* `../../..` --- parent of parent of parent directory
* etc.


## Interacting with the Shell
* Tab auto-fills and/or shows options
* Tab once: complete if possible, otherwise do nothing
* Tab twice: show possibilities


## Making Things Case Insensitvie
* (Linux Only!): To make your shell case-insensitive.
* Macs already do this by default.

```bash
if [ ! -a ~/.inputrc ]; then
  echo "\$include /etc/inputrc" > ~/.inputrc
fi

echo "set completion-ignore-case On" >> ~/.inputrc
```

* A later homework exercise is to describe in words what this does.


## Flags and Options
* Passing arguments to a function/command
  * Flags: `-` 
  * Options: `--`
* Similar behavior, different interpretation.
* Often a command has a flag and an argument to do the same thing!
* Rough translation:
    * R: `foo(option=3, f=TRUE)`
    * Shell: `foo -f --option 3`


## Why the Multiple Syntax?
* Flags are always a single character.
* Multiple charcaters interpreted as multiple flags!
* `ls -la` same as `ls -al` same as `ls -l -a` 






# System Monitoring

## Storage Space
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{what it does} \\\hline
    du & Disk Usage of folder or current dir \\
    df & File system report \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


## Example
```bash
du /tmp
df
df -h
```



## Processes
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{what it does} \\\hline
    top & remove file/dir \\
    kill & copy file/dir \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}





# Working with Files
## Managing Files

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{what it does} \\\hline
    ls & list folder contents \\
    cd & change directory \\
    rm & remove file/dir \\
    cp & copy file/dir \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


## Paths
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{what it does} \\\hline
    `pwd` & Print working directory \\
    `.` & Here \\
    `..` & One directory up \\
    `~` & Home \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


## Example
```{bash}
cd ~
mkdir examples
cd ~/examples
pwd
```


## Hidden Files
* Files beginning with `.` are hidden
* See them with `ls -a`


## Example
```{bash}
ls
touch .example
ls
ls -l
rm .example
```





## Interacting with Files
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
    \textbf{Command} & \textbf{what it does} \\\hline
    `head` & see first few lines of file \\
    `tail` & see last few lines of file \\
    `cat` & "concatenate" \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}



## Permissions
* Some users have root-like access via `su` and/or `sudo`
    * In Ubuntu, `sudo su` changes to root
    * **BE CAREFUL WHEN RUNNING COMMANDS AS ROOT** (even with `sudo`!)


## Installing Software
* If you have access to root/`sudo`: *very* easy!
* If you don't, often must build from source (can be hard!)


## Example (Ubuntu)
```bash
tree # not installed!
sudo apt-get update
# enter your password when prompted...
sudo apt-get install tree
tree
```






# Pipes and Redirection
## Pipes
* `|` (`shift`+`\` on American keyboards)
* Chains together multiple commands
* Works like function composition:
    * `foo(bar(x))`
    * `bar x | foo`
* Flags/options rules still apply:
    * `foo(bar(x, f=TRUE), option=3)`
    * `bar x -f | foo --option 3`


## Example
```bash
ls -l | tail
ls -l | tail -n 2
```


## Redirection
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
    \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{what it does} \\\hline
    $>$ & redirect (overwrite) \\
    $>>$ & redirect (append)
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}






# Searching

## Your New Best Friend: grep
* `grep`: Global Regular Expression Printer
* Tool for searching text files with complex patterns.
* ***EXTREMELY USEFUL***
* More advanced features next time


## My 5 Most Used Commands (descending order)
* cd
* ls
* git
* vim
* grep







# Misc





## Misc Useful Stuff
* Download files: `curl` and `wget`
* Browse the web like it's 1990: `lynx`
* Connect to a remote machine: `ssh`
* Move files to/from remote machines: `scp` and `sftp`
