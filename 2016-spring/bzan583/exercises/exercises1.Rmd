*Due*: Feb 1, 2016 by the beginning of class.

You can use whatever shell/OS you like, but I will assume you have access to GNU flags/userland, and your work will be graded accordingly.  If you don't know what this means, use the Ubuntu VM or Newton machine and you're good to go.



1. (10 pts) Explain briefly in words what the command `ls` does if you enter it into the terminal?  What about `# ls` (include the leading `#` symbol)?  Briefly, explain the difference.



2. (10 pts) For each of the following, determine if there is a difference between the pairs of commands.  If there is a difference, briefly explain why (if there is none, simply say so).
    a. `ls -ahl` and `ls -lah`
    b. `ls -ahl` and `ls -a -h -l`
    c. `ls -si` and `ls --si`



3. (10 pts) In words, what does the following command do?

```bash
grep -iR "foo" *
```


4. (10 pts) Produce valid syntax for a command that takes the list of the first 5 files in your home directory in long listing format and writes this to a new file (overwriting if necessary) called `first5.txt`.  (Hint: `ls`, `head`, redirection+pipes.  `man` is your friend).



5. (10 pts) Using the `wc` command, give valid syntax to count the number of:

    a. characters
    b. words
    c. lines

of the file `/etc/passwd`
