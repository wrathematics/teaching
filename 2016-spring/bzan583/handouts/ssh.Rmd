# Preliminaries

## Software

If you're on a Mac (or Linux), you don't need to install these.  You have a terminal and ssh tools already on your OS.  You can open a terminal in Finder, under the utilities section (called `Terminal.app`).

Windows users will need to install some additional software:

1. Putty (ssh): http://www.putty.org/
2. WINSCP (scp/sftp): https://winscp.net/eng/download.php://winscp.net/eng/download.php



## Terminology

* **ssh**: "secure shell".  A way of securely (i.e., with encryption) connecting to a remote machine and executing commands on it.  The term is used interchangeably with the protocol and also the software.

# Notes for Mac and Linux Users

There is a way to configure ssh to be much simpler to use, so you do not have to remember numerous cumbersome host names (like `newlogin.newton.utk.edu`), usernames, etc.  You can store the relevant information in the `~/.ssh/config` file (which you will create if it does not already exist).

```
Host newton
Port 22
HostName newlogin.newton.utk.edu
User your_user_name
TCPKeepAlive yes
ForwardX11 no
ServerAliveInterval 30
```

Now, instead of having to remember all of this information, you can simply type:

```
ssh newton
```

or whatever name you provided in the `Host` field.

Strictly speaking, not all of this information is needed (such as the `Port` field if the listening port is 22).  Additionally, there are numerous other options.  See `man ssh` for more information.
